    - When NAV is configured for single-tenancy, just replace the placeholder with the value of the the aad tenant id.
    - When NAV is configured for multi-tenancy, and the corresponding AAD application is also configured as a multi-tenant application, use "common" as the {AADTENANTID} value.

  <!--
    Specifies the App ID URI that is registered for Microsoft Dynamics NAV in the Microsoft Azure Active Directory.
    The App ID URI is used when Microsoft Dynamics NAV web services are configured for OAuth authentication, i.e., when the ClientServicesCredentialType is AccessControlService.
    The App ID URI is a logical identifier and doesn't have to represent a valid location, although it is common practice to use the physical URL of the Microsoft Dynamics NAV service.
    Example of valid AppIdUri:
       https://localhost:7047/
  -->
  <add key="AppIdUri" value="" />
  <!--
    Specifies the sign-in page that Microsoft Dynamics NAV redirects to when configured for Single Sign-On.
    For Azure AD (Office 365) authentication, the WSFederationLoginEndpoint setting has the following format:
         https://login.microsoftonline.com/<AAD TENANT ID>/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=<APP ID URI>%26wreply=<APP RETURN URL>
        Where
        "<AAD TENANT ID>" is the ID of the Azure AD tenant, for example "CRONUSInternationLtd.onmicrosoft.com".
        "<APP ID URI>" is the ID that was assigned to the Microsoft Dynamics NAV application when it was registered in Azure AD, for example "https://localhost/".
        "<APP RETURN URL>" is the reply URL that was assigned to the Microsoft Dynamics NAV application when it was registered in Azure AD, for example "https://localhost/".
    The following ensures that Microsoft Dynamics NAV redirects to the right sign-in page:
        - When NAV is configured for single-tenancy, just write the URL with has the same format as specified above.
        - When NAV is configured for multi-tenancy, and the corresponding AAD application is also configured as a multi-tenant application, use "common" as the {AADTENANTID} value.
        - When NAV is configured for multi-tenancy, and each NAV tenant corresponds to an AAD tenant, which contains an AAD service principal, use "{AADTENANTID}" as the value.
          NAV will automatically replace that value with the value that was used when mounting the NAV tenant, for example https://login.microsoftonline.com/{AADTENANTID}/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=...%26wreply=...

    The following ensures that the Azure AD sign-in page redirects back to Microsoft Dynamics NAV correctly:
        - When Microsoft Dynamics NAV redirects to the Azure AD sign-in page, it dynamically adds a wreply query parameter.
          This is how Azure AD knows how to redirect back to Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
        - In some cases, the dynamically added wreply query parameter is not what you want. This is the case when the public URL
          is different from the private URL on which Microsoft Dynamics NAV actually lives. An example is when Microsoft
          Dynamics NAV is deployed in a load-balanced environment, where the public URL is that of the load-balancer,
          and the private URLs are different for each Microsoft Dynamics NAV instance.
        - To enable scenarios where the public URL is different from the private URL, you must hard-code the public URL in the WSFederationLoginEndpoint.
          In the following example, the public URL is https://www.cronusinternational.com:
            https://login.microsoftonline.com/<AAD TENANT ID>/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=<APP ID URI>%26wreply=https://www.cronusinternational.com/NAV/WebClient/SignIn.aspx

        - Furthermore, Microsoft Dynamics NAV may be configured to use host name-based tenant resolution, i.e., each tenant is assigned a unique
          domain such as customer1.cronusinternational.com. A customer then accesses their tenant using e.g. https://customer1.cronusinternational.com/NAV/WebClient.
          This implies that the public URL is different for each tenant. To support this scenario, you can specify that the host name should be dynamically
          calculated by Microsoft Dynamics NAV as follows:
            https://login.microsoftonline.com/<AAD TENANT ID>/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=<APP ID URI>%26wreply=https://{HOSTNAME}/NAV/WebClient/SignIn.aspx
          Microsoft Dynamics NAV replaces the placeholder with the actual request domain at runtime, resulting in:
            https://login.microsoftonline.com/<AAD TENANT ID>/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=<APP ID URI>%26wreply=https://customer1.cronusinternational.com/NAV/WebClient/SignIn.aspx

        -  The value for AppIdUri can also be used to substitute a placeholder {APPIDURI} value with the value specified in the AppIdUri configuration setting.
             https://login.microsoftonline.com/<AAD TENANT ID>/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm={APPIDURI}%26wreply=....

    For ACS authentication, the WSFederationLoginEndpoint setting is a top level partition of ACS that is used to create the ACS tokens, for example "https://CRONUSInternationalLtd.accesscontrol.windows.net/v2/wsfederation?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=https://localhost/"
